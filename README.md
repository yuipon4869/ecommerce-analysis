# ðŸ“Š Sales Prediction Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes e-commerce sales data to predict future sales trends. By leveraging data visualization and machine learning techniques, we aim to provide insights that can help in strategic decision-making for inventory management and marketing.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - E-commerce Sales Prediction Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nevildhinoja/e-commerce-sales-prediction-dataset/data))
- **Description**: The dataset includes historical sales data from a retail store, encompassing various product categories, sales figures, and promotional information.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Project Structure

1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Utilized scatter plots and heatmaps to identify relationships between variables.  
   - Assessed data distribution and detected outliers.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Performed feature engineering to create new predictive variables.

3. **Model Building**  
   - Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics.
   - Implemented and compared multiple regression models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.

4. **Results Visualization**  
   - Presented findings through graphs and charts for better interpretability.

## Challenges and Learnings
  - **Feature Selection**: Determining the most impactful features required iterative testing and domain understanding. I learned the importance of balancing feature complexity with model interpretability.
  - **Model Evaluation**: Comparing different regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) helped me understand the trade-offs between accuracy and explainability.

## Conclusion

The analysis provided valuable insights into sales patterns, highlighting key factors influencing sales performance. The predictive model achieved satisfactory accuracy, demonstrating the potential of data-driven approaches in retail strategy.
